In the case of modified Exp.2, i do nothing more than add my own configuration folder "secrets" including "mqtt.h" and "wifi.h" which hold my MQTT information(broker, port, username, password) and WiFi setting information correspondingly. Btw, i insert Hivemq CA Certification(TLS) in "ca_cert.h" file. Things work well, i get the same result as expected since it is about changing the broker.
